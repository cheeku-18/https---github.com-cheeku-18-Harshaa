            <p>Title: "Rainy Love Lament"<br><br>
            Verse 1:<br>
            The rain is falling, but my heart's dry,<br>
            In the soothing winds, I hear you sigh,<br>
            Every drop reminds me of your touch,<br>
            How I miss you, darling, oh so much.<br><br>

            Chorus:<br>
            Oh, in this rainy season, my hediv aches,<br>
            Without you, the magic of the rain breaks,<br>
            Not just this season, but every time,<br>
            I want you here, forever mine.<br><br>

            Verse 2:<br>
            The moon hides its light, the streets are bare,<br>
            Without you beside me, life’s not fair,<br>
            Why won’t the heavens hear my plea?<br>
            As they grant rain to those who seek, but not me.<br><br>

            Chorus:<br>
            Oh, in this rainy season, my heart aches,<br>
            Without you, the magic of the rain breaks,<br>
            Not just this season, but every time,<br>
            I want you here, forever mine.<br><br>

            Bridge:<br>
            From teenage dreams to twilight years,<br>
            Through joy and sorrow, laughter and tears,<br>
            I want to hold you, through it all,<br>
            Together, forever, we'll stand tall.<br><br>

            Chorus:<br>
            Oh, in this rainy season, my heart aches,<br>
            Without you, the magic of the rain breaks,<br>
            Not just this season, but every time,<br>
            I want you here, forever mine.<br><br>

            Verse 3:<br>
            The moon won’t shine, the night feels cold,<br>
            Without you, life seems so old,<br>
            God, why can't you hear my call?<br>
            Bring my love back, through it all.<br><br>

            Chorus:<br>
            Oh, in this rainy season, my heart aches,<br>
            Without you, the magic of the rain breaks,<br>
            Not just this season, but every time,<br>
            I want you here, forever mine.<br><br>

            Outro:<br>
            The rain keeps falling, but I feel no joy,<br>
            Until you're here, my love, my soul's decoy,<br>
            From this season to life's last breath,<br>
            I’ll love you, darling, beyond death.</p>

                <p>Title: "Love Through the Years"<br><br>
                (Verse 1)<br>
                In the heat of summer, high school days,<br>
                I saw you from afar, in a golden haze.<br>
                Your hair caught the sunlight, I didn’t see your face,<br>
                But in that fleeting moment, my heart found its place.<br><br>
    
                (Pre-Chorus)<br>
                Every girl since then, just a shadow in the crowd,<br>
                'Cause my eyes are on you, you're the one I vowed.<br>
                I didn’t need to know your name or even where you’re from,<br>
                For me, it was you, right there and then, my heart was won.<br><br>
    
                (Chorus)<br>
                I said I wanna marry you, not just a date,<br>
                Even back in high school, when we were just kids, it was fate.<br>
                Can’t imagine life with anyone but you,<br>
                I just wanna be loved by you, my dreams coming true.<br><br>
    
                (Verse 2)<br>
                Years have passed, but my love's still pure,<br>
                From that first glance, I knew it was sure.<br>
                You never knew me, but for me, you were the one,<br>
                My heart's been yours since that first ray of sun.<br><br>
    
                (Bridge)<br>
                And every time I see you, I fall in love again,<br>
                Your smile, your touch, you’re more than just a friend.<br>
                Through every phase and season, my love's only grown,<br>
                In this life, you're the only love I’ve ever known.<br><br>
    
                (Chorus)<br>
                I said I wanna marry you, not just a date,<br>
                Even back in high school, when we were just kids, it was fate.<br>
                Can’t imagine life with anyone but you,<br>
                I just wanna be loved by you, my dreams coming true.<br><br>
    
                (Outro)<br>
                Now here we stand, on the edge of forever,<br>
                With you by my side, I’ll face any weather.<br>
                From that high school summer,to this very day,<br>

                (Final Chorus)<br>
                I said I wanna marry you, not just a date,<br>
                Even back in high school, when we were just kids, it was fate.<br>
                Can’t imagine life with anyone but you,<br>
                I just wanna be loved by you, my dreams coming true.<br>

                (Final Outro)<br>
                In every lifetime, it's you I'll choose,<br>
                Since that first summer, I’ve had nothing to lose.<br>
                So, take my hand, let's make this vow true,<br>
                I wanna marry you, just me and you.<br><br>

        <img src="/assets/img/zx.jpg" alt="Be With Me" class="song-image">
        <p>This song is about my deepest feelings for you, Harsha, and how much I long for you to be with me forever.</p>
        <div class="song-lyrics">
            <p>(Verse 1)<br>
            Met a lot of faces, seen a lot of eyes,<br>
            But none of them could ever compare to your light.<br>
            In a crowded room, you’re the one I see,<br>
            A heart like yours, it’s a rarity.</p>

            <p>(Pre-Chorus)<br>
            When the world is spinning and it’s hard to find,<br>
            Someone who feels like a one-of-a-kind.<br>
            So I’m holding on, won’t you hold on too?<br>
            Cause in this life, all I need is you.</p>

            <p>(Chorus)<br>
            You’re the one, you’re the dream,<br>
            You’re the reason I believe.<br>
            Don’t break my heart, be with me,<br>
            Together we can be so free.<br>
            You’re the light in the dark,<br>
            You’re my compass, my North Star.<br>
            Don’t break my heart, be with me,<br>
            Cause you’re the one I see.</p>

            <p>(Verse 2)<br>
            Been around the world, chased a thousand dreams,<br>
            But every road kept leading me back to you, it seems.<br>
            In the silent moments when the day is through,<br>
            I find my peace just thinking of you.</p>

            <p>(Pre-Chorus)<br>
            When the night is cold and it’s hard to sleep,<br>
            I feel your warmth in every memory.<br>
            So I’m holding on, won’t you hold on tight?<br>
            Cause you and me, we can make it right.</p>

            <p>(Chorus)<br>
            You’re the one, you’re the dream,<br>
            You’re the reason I believe.<br>
            Don’t break my heart, be with me,<br>
            Together we can be so free.<br>
            You’re the light in the dark,<br>
            You’re my compass, my North Star.<br>
            Don’t break my heart, be with me,<br>
            Cause you’re the one I see.</p>

            <p>(Bridge)<br>
            When the clouds come rolling in,<br>
            And life’s a storm we’re caught within.<br>
            I’ll be your shelter, be your calm,<br>
            Together we’ll weather any harm.</p>

            <p>(Chorus)<br>
            You’re the one, you’re the dream,<br>
            You’re the reason I believe.<br>
            Don’t break my heart, be with me,<br>
            Together we can be so free.<br>
            You’re the light in the dark,<br>
            You’re my compass, my North Star.<br>
            Don’t break my heart, be with me,<br>
            Cause you’re the one I see.</p>

            <p>(Outro)<br>
            So take my hand, let’s start anew,<br>
            Cause in this life, all I need is you.<br>
            You’re the one, can’t you see?<br>
            So don’t break my heart, just be with me.</p>
